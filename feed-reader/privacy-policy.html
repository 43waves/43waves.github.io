    <h1>Feed Reader Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: February 5, 2026</em></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Feed Reader ("the App") is developed by 43waves. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how the App handles your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <h3>What We Don't Collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No personal information</strong> - We don't collect names, emails, or account data</li>
      <li><strong>No usage data sent to our servers</strong> - Your preferences stay on your device</li>
      <li><strong>No tracking by us</strong> - We don't track your behavior or location</li>
      <li><strong>No analytics</strong> - We don't use any analytics or tracking services</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Stays On Your Device</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Feed URLs</strong> - The RSS and Atom feed URLs you subscribe to</li>
      <li><strong>Read status</strong> - Which articles you've already read</li>
      <li><strong>Theme preference</strong> - Your selected theme (System/Light/Dark)</li>
      <li><strong>View mode</strong> - Your preferred article view (Grouped/Flat)</li>
      <li><strong>Read filter</strong> - Your preferred filter setting (All/Unread)</li>
      <li><strong>Backup settings</strong> - Auto-backup preference and backup files</li>
      <li><strong>Ad cooldown</strong> - Timestamp to limit ad frequency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the app or clearing app data.</p>

    <h2>Network Requests</h2>
    <p>The App makes network requests to fetch RSS and Atom feeds from URLs you provide. These requests go directly to the feed servers you subscribe to - we don't route them through our servers or collect any information about your subscriptions.</p>

    <h2>Backup Files</h2>
    <p>The App can create backup files (in OPML format) stored in your device's Downloads folder. These files contain only your feed URLs and are stored locally on your device. You control whether to share these files.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>The App displays advertisements powered by Google AdMob. When ads are shown, Google may collect certain information as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>General location (country/region level)</li>
      <li>Ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can learn more about Google's advertising practices and opt-out options at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">Google's Ads Settings</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Ad Frequency</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ads are shown when opening the app (cold start) or returning to it (resume)</li>
      <li>A cooldown period ensures you won't see ads too frequently</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <h3>Internet Access</h3>
    <p>Required to fetch RSS and Atom feeds from the URLs you subscribe to, and to display advertisements.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The advertising shown is handled by Google AdMob, which has its own policies regarding personalized advertising.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
