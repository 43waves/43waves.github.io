    <h1>Note Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: February 25, 2026</em></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Note ("the App") is developed by 43waves. We are committed to protecting
       your privacy. This policy explains how the App handles your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <h3>What We Don't Collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No personal information</strong> - We don't collect names, emails,
          or account data</li>
      <li><strong>No usage data sent to our servers</strong> - Your notes and
          preferences stay on your device</li>
      <li><strong>No tracking by us</strong> - We don't track your behavior or
          location</li>
      <li><strong>No analytics</strong> - We don't use any analytics or tracking
          services</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Stays On Your Device</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Notes</strong> - Your notes are stored locally in a SQLite database
          on your device</li>
      <li><strong>Backup files</strong> - When you create a backup, it is saved as a
          JSON file in your device's Downloads folder</li>
      <li><strong>Theme preference</strong> - Your selected theme
          (System/Light/Dark)</li>
      <li><strong>Auto backup setting</strong> - Whether automatic backup is
          enabled</li>
      <li><strong>Onboarding status</strong> - Whether you've completed initial
          setup</li>
      <li><strong>Ad cooldown</strong> - Timestamp to limit ad frequency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the app
       or clearing app data.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>The App displays advertisements powered by Google AdMob. When ads are shown,
       Google may collect certain information as described in
       <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
       This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>General location (country/region level)</li>
      <li>Ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can learn more about Google's advertising practices and opt-out options at
       <a href="https://adssettings.google.com">Google's Ads Settings</a>.</p>

    <h3>Ad Frequency</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ads are shown when opening the app (cold start) or returning to it
          (resume)</li>
      <li>Ads only appear after initial setup is complete</li>
      <li>A cooldown period ensures you won't see ads too frequently</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <h3>Storage Access (Android 9 and below)</h3>
    <p>On devices running Android 9 (SDK 28) or below, the App requests storage
       permission to save and read backup files in the Downloads folder. On Android 10
       and above, this is handled through the system's MediaStore API without needing
       explicit permission.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
       The advertising shown is handled by Google AdMob, which has its own policies
       regarding personalized advertising.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on
       this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this
       policy periodically.</p>
