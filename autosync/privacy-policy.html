    <h1>Autosync Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: January 14, 2026</em></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Autosync ("the App") is developed by 43waves. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how the App handles your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <h3>What We Don't Collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No personal information</strong> - We don't collect names, emails, or account data</li>
      <li><strong>No usage data sent to servers</strong> - Your sync preferences stay on your device</li>
      <li><strong>No tracking</strong> - We don't track your behavior or location</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Stays On Your Device</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sync Mode</strong> - Your selected sync mode (Power, WiFi, Interval, etc.)</li>
      <li><strong>Interval Settings</strong> - Your configured sync interval and conditions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the app or clearing app data.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>Used to display the foreground service notification showing current sync status. Required for Android 8.0+ background operation.</p>

    <h3>Internet</h3>
    <p>Used only for displaying advertisements. No personal data is transmitted by the App itself.</p>

    <h3>Network &amp; WiFi State</h3>
    <p>Used to detect your current network connection status (mobile data, WiFi, or disconnected). This enables the WiFi-only sync mode and checks connectivity before enabling sync.</p>

    <h3>Sync Settings</h3>
    <p>Used to read and modify Android's master sync setting. This is the core functionality of the App - automatically enabling or disabling sync based on your configured conditions.</p>

    <h3>Run at Startup</h3>
    <p>Used to restore your sync settings after device reboot.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>The App displays ads provided by Google AdMob. The App uses Google's Advertising ID to serve ads. Google may collect and use data for personalized advertising as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>You can opt out of personalized ads in your device's Google settings.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. The App is suitable for general audiences.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
