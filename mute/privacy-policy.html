    <h1>Mute Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: January 13, 2026</em></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Mute ("the App") is developed by 43waves. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how the App handles your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <h3>What We Don't Collect</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No personal information</strong> - We don't collect names, emails, or account data</li>
      <li><strong>No usage data sent to our servers</strong> - Your preferences stay on your device</li>
      <li><strong>No tracking by us</strong> - We don't track your behavior or location</li>
      <li><strong>No analytics</strong> - We don't use any analytics or tracking services</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What Stays On Your Device</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Theme preference</strong> - Your selected theme (System/Light/Dark)</li>
      <li><strong>Silent duration</strong> - Your configured auto-reset duration</li>
      <li><strong>Reset time</strong> - Scheduled time for ringer mode reset</li>
      <li><strong>Ad cooldown</strong> - Timestamp to limit ad frequency</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data never leaves your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the app or clearing app data.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>The App displays advertisements powered by Google AdMob. When ads are shown, Google may collect certain information as described in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers</li>
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>General location (country/region level)</li>
      <li>Ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can learn more about Google's advertising practices and opt-out options at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">Google's Ads Settings</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Ad Frequency</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Ads are only shown on app launch after initial setup is complete</li>
      <li>A cooldown period ensures you won't see ads too frequently</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <h3>Do Not Disturb Access</h3>
    <p>Required to change your device's ringer mode between Normal, Vibrate, and Silent. On Android 6.0+, setting the ringer mode to Silent also enables Do Not Disturb - this is how Android works by design. This permission is used solely for the app's core functionality.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The advertising shown is handled by Google AdMob, which has its own policies regarding personalized advertising.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
